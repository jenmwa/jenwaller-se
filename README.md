# Portfolio för LIAsök hösten 2023.

I wanted to try out VUE for myself after our team assignment in the course Graphical tools for interface design. Really enjoy working with components and this suits me very well!<br>
Used VITE as my bundler, VUE with JAVASCRIPT as framework, packages as ESLINT and PRETTIER for linting and formatting and SASS as my stylesheet language.<br>
I do really enjoy working with details, old school CSS animations, and with VUE, new, but simple effective ways of getting a site come to life.<br><br><br>

And this is what came out.
A onepager, classic portfolio design and the graphic element is based on the hero image. And with a lot of CSS, details and something I really enjoyed create!
